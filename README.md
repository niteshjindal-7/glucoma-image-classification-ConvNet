# glucome-image-classification-ConvNet
The high-level way a convolution neural network works is as follows-

Referring to our example and the given illustration, we have input retinal images of glucoma(infected which we name as positive images) and there are normal retinal images(non-infected which we name as negative images). We are applying Convolution neural network to classify or distinguish between normal and glucoma retinal eye image on unknown or test images.

Dataset which is being used in the given repository can be found at below link.

However, for demonstration purpose, we have taken a sample images from the given path that can be accessed through below link-
